# METRICS
## 1. Ride duration average between user types
avg_ride_duration <- cleaned_data[, .(avg_ride_duration = mean(ride_duration)), by = member_casual]
print(avg_ride_duration)

## 2. Ride frequency per user type
ride_frequency <- cleaned_data[, .N, by = .(member_casual, day_of_week)]
print(ride_frequency[order(member_casual, -N)])


## 3. Time of usage - Peak usage time for user types
peak_usage <- cleaned_data[, .N, by = .(member_casual, hour_of_day)]
print(peak_usage[order(member_casual, hour_of_day)])


## 4. Seasonality Patterns - Usage changes over the months in the year

# Load `lubridate` package
library(lubridate)

# Extract month from started_at for additional column
cleaned_data[, month := month(started_at, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)]

# Count rides by month and member type
monthly_usage <- cleaned_data[, .N, by = .(member_casual, month)]
print(monthly_usage[order(member_casual, month)])


## 5. Geographical patterns - Most popular start & end stations 

# Filter rows with complete station data

                               !is.na(end_station_id)]

# 5.1 Count rides by start station and member type
popular_start_stations <- station_data[, .N, by = .(member_casual, start_station_name)]
print(popular_start_stations[order(member_casual, -N)])

# The output included blank station names,
# likely due to the fact those cells are not empty but rather contain spaces as input

# Filter out rows with empty or missing station names
popular_start_stations <- popular_start_stations[start_station_name != "" & !is.na(start_station_name)]
# Reorder the data
popular_start_stations <- popular_start_stations[order(member_casual, -N)]

# 5.2 Count rides by end station and member type
popular_end_stations <- station_data[, .N, by = .(member_casual, end_station_name)]
print(popular_end_stations[order(member_casual, -N)])

# The output included blank station names,
# likely due to the fact those cells are not empty but rather contain spaces as input

# Filter out rows with empty or missing station names

# Reorder the data
